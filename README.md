# Knotz3DPortfolio

Welcome to my 3D portfolio project, a comprehensive showcase of my skills and experience as a developer. This portfolio is designed using advanced 3D web design techniques, reflecting my ability to work with cutting-edge technologies and create engaging user experiences.

## Project Overview

This portfolio includes a selection of my best work, demonstrating my versatility as a developer. From game development to web design, each project in this portfolio represents a unique aspect of my capabilities. The projects are presented in a dynamic 3D environment, making the portfolio itself a testament to my technical skills.

## Featured Projects

Each project featured in this portfolio includes a brief description, a link to the code repository, and a live demo. These projects were carefully selected to showcase my ability to solve complex problems, adapt to various technologies, and effectively manage all stages of development.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on a Web browser. Three.js allows the creation of GPU-accelerated 3D animations using the JavaScript language without having to use proprietary browser plugins.
